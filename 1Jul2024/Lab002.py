# Keyword and Identifier
#Eg - Bottle - can we say it as Orange
# Orange is different and bottle is different
# Keywords are nothing but Reserved words - They have certain different meaning in Python
# and you cannot use them
# Keywords can be in Lower case or upper case

# Variable
#Variables are like container. They are used to store value.
# variable name = variable value
age = 45
age = 31
# python is dynamically typed
age = "Sneha" # now again contains "Sneha" previouly it was 31 so it dynamically typed , no need to define any kind of data type
# python interpreter is like our Mom , when it is 9 she will automatically prepare breakfast

# can we have
#class = "Test" # y we cant have this as it is a keyword . We cannot have keyword as variable type.
# Rules of Variable
# we cannot use keywords
# We cannot start variable name with number - 234kkk
#1234 = "test"
# It can start with _\
_1234 = "Test"
print(_1234 )
# we can have only _ as well
_ = "Testing "
print(_)
